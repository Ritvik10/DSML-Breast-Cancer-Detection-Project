# DSML-Breast-Cancer-Detection-Project

As per our discussion for the Project assignment of CS3203 Data Science & Machine Learning, you all need to collect some dataset from the internet according to the project you have mentioned & submitted to your course instructor in the starting, (For example, Kaggle, UCI ) and perform any 1 classification method on it (For example, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree etc.) and prepare a report, presentation ppt and demonstration video on it. 
 
The report, presentation ppt and demonstration video should include these points 

1.	Introduction of problem 

2.	Dataset description 

3.	The algorithm used description (brief only equations and short description) 

4.	Data Visualization (any two) 

5.	Result analysis on the basis of: 

6.	a) Confusion matrix 

7.	b) ROC 

8.	c) Evaluation Parameter for three train test ratio 70:30, 80:20, 60:40 table for evaluation parameter 
Table to be filled with any one Algorithm:
